# Map-Struct in Java

- This project contains an example of complex object mapping using `map-struct`.
- In this project, I have implemented a mapper to map one object of type `Product` to another object of type `ProductDTO`.
- Implemented the mapper using `map-struct` and also wrote unit test cases for the same.
